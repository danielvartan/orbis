## Overview

`orbis` is an R package that offers a suite of tools for simplifying
spatial data analysis.

## Installation

You can install `orbis` using the
[`remotes`](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes) package:

``` r
remotes::install_github("danielvartan/orbis")
```

## Usage

`orbis` is equipped with several functions to help with your analysis,
such as:

- [`filter_points_on_land`](https://danielvartan.github.io/orbis/reference/Filter_points_on_land.html):
  Filters latitude/longitude points that intersects with a given
  [`sf`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) geometry.
- [`get_brazil_municipality`](https://danielvartan.github.io/orbis/reference/get_brazil_municipality.html):
  Get Brazilian municipalities data.
- [`get_sidra_by_year`](https://danielvartan.github.io/orbis/reference/get_sidra_by_year.html):
  Get and aggregate data by year from
  [SIDRA](https://sidra.ibge.gov.br/) API (to avoid overloading).
- [`shift_and_rotate`](https://danielvartan.github.io/orbis/reference/shift_and_rotate.html):
  Shift and rotate raster or vector data.
- [`shift and_crop`](https://danielvartan.github.io/orbis/reference/shift_and_crop.html):
  Shift, rotate, and crop a raster using a vector.
- [`wc_to_ascii`](https://danielvartan.github.io/orbis/reference/wc_to_ascii.html):
  Convert [WorldClim](https://worldclim.org/)
  [GeoTIFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoTIFF) files to
  [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esri_grid) raster format.

Example:

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(geodata)
library(orbis)
library(terra)
```

``` r
raster <-
  expand.grid(
    seq(-179.75, 179.75, by = 0.5),
    seq(-89.75, 89.75, by = 0.5)
  ) |>
  as_tibble() |>
  rename(x = Var1, y = Var2) |>
  mutate(value = rnorm(259200)) |>
  rast(type = "xyz") %>%
  `crs<-`("epsg:4326")

world_shape <- world(path = tempdir())
raster <- raster |> crop(world_shape, mask = TRUE)

raster |> plot()
```

vector |> plot()
```
